# BiQuad filter thoughts

bi-quad = two quadratics, quadratics being a second order equation.

There are a couple of new PDF's I downloaded on filtering. 
The general consensus seems to be that BiQuads perform poorly
at low frequencies, whereas state-variable filters perform 
poorly at high frequencies. 

State-variable filters have many fewer coefficients, thus should
be easier to sweep.

;  in biquadfilt.c, we find the below. Note that, sure enough,
;  they are ADDING the 'a' coefficients rather than subtracting.

## Earlevel code 
The below is from the 
[earlevel biquad source in C](https://www.earlevel.com/main/2012/11/26/biquad-c-source-code/)

Note that he swaps A and B.

Quotes:
"The direct forms are terrible choices if you want a
sweepable synthesizer filter, for instance..."

He advocates the "Chamberlin state-variable filter
"I donâ€™t suggest the Chamberlin SVF as-isâ€”itâ€™s only adequate
with oversampling, and there are much-improved versions..."
and he promises a blog post on them (but so far doesn't seem to have)

```c++
    double norm;
    double V = pow(10, fabs(peakGain) / 20.0);
    double K = tan(M_PI * Fc);

    //  (was part of a switch - lowpass)

    norm = 1 / (1 + K / Q + K * K);
    a0 = K * K * norm;                  // NOTE! this author
    a1 = 2 * a0;                        // SWAPS A and B!!    
    a2 = a0;
    b1 = 2 * (K * K - 1) * norm;
    b2 = (1 - K / Q + K * K) * norm;
    break;


    inline float Biquad::process(float in) {
        double out = in * a0 + z1;
        z1 = in * a1 + z2 - b1 * out;
        z2 = in * a2 - b2 * out;
        return out;
    }
```
