
Use a distinct substring of the LABEL field to identify a device.
You can supply the same ID either to this application or to the main synth.

If two devices share the same label, they should be differentiated by
the number of Transmitters and Receivers each has.

Transmitters send MIDI messages as input to the application

Receivers receive MIDI messages as output from the application.


Yes, it's confusing. The JavaSound convention is to express
"input" and "output" from the perspective of the mixer,
rather than of the application.
