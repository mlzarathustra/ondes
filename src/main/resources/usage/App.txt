    System settings:
        Select input and output devices:
          -in <input MIDI device>
          -out <output Audio device>

      The 'device' label is used to search for a device with
      the necessary capabilities whose label contains that string.

      See READ.md for help finding devices in your system.

    Program settings:
        Display then Exit:
            -show-patches

                 A patch is identified by either its name or the

            -show-patch <patch name | index>

        Select:
            -all | -patch <(patch name | index) for all channels>
            -ch1 <patch for channel 1>
            -ch2 < "     "    "     2>
            ...

       Patches can be supplied as YAML files in the directory
       ./program; a number are supplied internally as resources.
