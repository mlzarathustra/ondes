    OndeSynthesizer
    ---------------------------
    System settings:
        Select input and output devices:
            -in <input MIDI device>
            -out <output Audio device>

        The 'device' label is used to search for a device with
        the necessary capabilities whose label contains that string.

        See README.md for help finding devices in your system.

        These two settings are required, as the synth cannot play without
        notes coming in and audio going out.

    Program settings:
        You can either list the programs to have them distributed to the
        available channels in order, or you can specify the channel.
        (Below, "o" is the command consisting of the lowercase letter "o")
        For example, on my system the following works:

            o -in 828 -out speaker octave-organ

        If you put the required -in and -out settings in ondes-args,
        you can simply give patch names on the command line.

        for example:
            o glock bell organ

        The above will load the specified programs on channels 1,2, and 3.

        To see what programs are available, use -list
            o -list
                 Lists the patch names available, and their indexes
                 A patch is identified by either its name or the
                 index as given by this command.

            o -list -all
                Same as the above, but includes patches in the
                subdirectories of the filesystem 'program' directory.

                Index numbers will change when -all is set.

            o -show-patch <patch name | index>
            o -all -show-patch <patch name | index>

                Displays the patch. You will need -all if the patch
                resides in a subdirectory. Note that using -all may
                change the index number.

        To explicitly assign a channel, use this syntax:

            -ch1 <{patch name | index} for channel 1>
            -ch2 <{patch name | index} for channel 2>
            ...

       Patches can be supplied as YAML files in the directory
       ./program; a number are supplied internally as resources.
       You can create your own. In fact, that's kind of the point.


    Miscellaneous settings:

       -log-main-out - dumps verbose debugging information into
            'update.log.' See doc/timing.md for more info.


       -buffer-size <size>

            If you get clicks or breaks in the sound, the audio buffer
            may need to be bigger. Default is 2048, which should be fairly
            safe. However, if you can get away with a smaller buffer
            without disruptions in sound, the synth may respond more
            quickly to keyboard input.

            OndeSynth displays the buffer size on startup.
            See README.md for more.

       -help or -h gives this help message
