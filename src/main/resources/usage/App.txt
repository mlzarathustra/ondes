
    Ondes Synthesizer
    ---------------------------
    Arguments are mostly in pairs:

    System settings:
        Select input and output devices:
          -in <input MIDI device>
          -out <output Audio device>

      The 'device' label is used to search for a device with
      the necessary capabilities whose label contains that string.

      See READ.md for help finding devices in your system.

        Audio System
          -buffer-size <size>

        If you get clicks or breaks in the sound, the audio buffer
        needs to be bigger. Default is 1024, which should work with
        most systems. See README.md for more.

    Program settings:
        Display then Exit:
            -show-patches
                 Lists the patch names available, and their indexes
                 A patch is identified by either its name or the
                 index as given by this command.

            -show-patch <patch name | index>

        Select:
            -all | -patch <(patch name | index) for all channels>
            -ch1 <patch for channel 1>
            -ch2 < "     "    "     2>
            ...

       Patches can be supplied as YAML files in the directory
       ./program; a number are supplied internally as resources.

       -help or -h gives this help message
