    ---------------------------
    Arguments are mostly in pairs:

    System settings:

      -in <input MIDI device>
      -out <output Audio device>

    See READ.md for help finding devices in your system.

    Program settings:
        Display then Exit
            -show-patches
                 Lists the patch names available, and their indexes
                 A patch is identified by either its name or the
                 index as given by this command.

            -show-patch <patch name | index>

        Select
            -all | -patch <(patch name | index) for all channels>
            -ch1 <patch for channel 1>
            -ch2 < "     "    "     2>
            ...

       Patches can be supplied as YAML files in the directory
            ./program

       A number are supplied internally as resources.

    The 'device label' is used to search for a device with
    the necessary capabilities whose label contains that string.

    patch files are in yaml, yet to be undocumented.
