
    Ondes Synthesizer
    ---------------------------
    Arguments are in pairs:

      -in <input MIDI device>
      -out <output Audio device>
      -all | -patch <patch file for all channels>
      -ch1 <patch file for channel 1>
      -ch2 < "     "    "    "     2>
       ...

    The 'device label' is used to search for a device with
    the necessary capabilities whose label contains that string.

    patch files are in yaml, yet to be undocumented.
