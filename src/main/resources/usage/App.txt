
    OndeSynthesizer
    ---------------------------
    System settings:
        Select input and output devices:
            -in <input MIDI device>
            -out <output Audio device>

        The 'device' label is used to search for a device with
        the necessary capabilities whose label contains that string.

        See README.md for help finding devices in your system.

            -buffer-size <size>

        If you get clicks or breaks in the sound, the audio buffer
        needs to be bigger. Default is 2048, which should be fairly
        safe. However, if you can get away with a smaller buffer
        without disruptions in sound, the synth will respond more
        quickly to keyboard input. It displays the buffer size on
        startup.

        See README.md for more.

    Program settings:
        Display then Exit:
            -show-patches
                 Lists the patch names available, and their indexes
                 A patch is identified by either its name or the
                 index as given by this command.

            -all-patches -show-patches
                Same as the above, but recursively traverses into
                subdirectories of the filesystem 'program' directory.

                Index numbers will change when -all-patches is set.

            -show-patch <patch name | index>
            -all-patches -show-patch <patch name | index>

        Select:
            -all | -patch <(patch name | index) for all channels>
            -ch1 <patch for channel 1>
            -ch2 < "     "    "     2>
            ...

       Patches can be supplied as YAML files in the directory
       ./program; a number are supplied internally as resources.

    Miscellaneous settings:

       -log-main-out - dumps verbose debugging information into
        'update.log.' See doc/timing.md for more info.

       -help or -h gives this help message
