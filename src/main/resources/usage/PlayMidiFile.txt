    Plays back a MIDI file into a .WAV file

    Syntax:
        java ondes.file.MixMidiFile \
            <input-filename>.mid <output-filename>.wav \
            <patch1> <patch2> ...

    The patches are specified exactly the same way as with the
    OndesSynth command - they can be numeric. If they're in sub-
    directories, you need to say "-all" to load them.

    Options:

        -overwrite - overwrite the wav file if it exists,
            rather than giving an error

        -sample-rate <nnn> - sets the sample rate for the
            wave output. Note that some filters (iir) currently
            are based on the 44100 sample rate, so the cutoff
            frequency will be higher with a higher sample rate.

        -ending-zeros <nnn> - after the last midi event, it
            waits for this many zeros before stopping.

        -fade-after <nnn> - number of seconds after the last
            midi event, after which it will fade out whether
            the output has gone to zero or not

        -fade-length <nnn> - number of seconds that it will
            fade for, if "fade-after" is activated.

    Options may appear in any order on the command line.

    For now, we assume 16 bit mono. The default sample rate
    is 44100.
